# A Mini project which will perform the following functions;
    - Convert between Hex, Decimal and Binary
    - Store the last 20 conversions
    - Perform this with a JavaFX GUI

 ## This project aims to;
    - Avoid using the java functions [Integer/Long].to[Hex/Binary]String to make things a bit more interesting
    - Adhere strictly to SOLID principles.
    - Make use of the MVC pattern encouraged by JavaFX
